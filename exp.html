                        <p>I am currently a Full Stack Engineer at Intellicheck. Since joining Intellicheck, I have become the lead engineer on a crucial React project. As one of 3 engineers, I have also worked hands-on with clients for troubleshooting implementation issues or curating UIs to their needs. I am in constant communication with other teams to ensure our code is steadily moving to client-facing environments. In my day-to-day, I use React, React Bootstrap, Bootstrap, and TypeScript, and I have recently been using Python more to implement backend solutions. I have also gotten some exposure to NextJS in another project.                            I do not consider myself an artist, but creating UIs makes me think otherwise! I love making responsive interfaces and new designs to present to the team.</p>

                        <p>I was a member of the R-House Lab from June 2020 to July 2023. I've had several roles in this position. I intially designed
                            interactions for social robots to have with humans. I then participated in
                            the HRI Student Design competition in 2021 and won the Best Student Design Competition

                            (purpose of living) and how a social robot

                        <p>From the May-August 2022, I worked as a
                            Software Engineer Intern at <a href="https://www.relativity.com/" class="hvr-sweep-to-top"

                            For most of the summer,
                            I worked individually on frontend tasks using JavaScript. While collaborating with the other intern on the team, we created a
                            NuGet package that would assist in retrieving data from New Relic Dashboard. We created Unit
                            Tests for this package, as well as for any individual task we had.
                            <br>
                            I learned how to debug and also learned the SCRUM process through Kanban. I created various
                            pull requests through BitBucket and frequently used the Networks tab in Chrome for Testing
                            API endpoints. Additionally, I became more efficient in communicating questions or progress
                            to my team, and became faster at assessing situations from interacting with other engineering teams.

                            so I and my two other colleagues created the foundation for the team. We worked in a fast
                            paced environment
                            with weekly deadlines to ensure that fun and informative events would happen once a month.

                            My role on the team would rotate with each event. I worked with Adobe Spark and XD for
                            designing flyers. I also
                            designed presentations and researched content. Because we were a new team, we also gathered
                            resources on AI, such as different existing
                            programming libraries, as well as movies, books, or starter projects, to provide everyone
                            who came to our events.
